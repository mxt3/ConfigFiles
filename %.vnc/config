# securitytypes=vncauth,tlsvnc
# NO idea what this does ....
# desktop=sandbox
# To only enable connections originating from same machine. Usefull for tunneling over ssh:
# localhost
# For configuring multiple access to server:
# alwaysshared


# name=ESAT_VNC
# we prefer x509vnc, as it offers server identification in addition
# to the typical tls encryption. However, not all clients support this.
# vncauth offers no encryption at all, only to be used over ssh.
